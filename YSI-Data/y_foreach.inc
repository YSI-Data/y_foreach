/**
					===========================
					 foreach efficient looping
					===========================
Description:
	Provides efficient looping through sparse data sets, such as connected
	players.  Significantly improved from the original version to be a generic
	loop system, rather then purely a player loop system.  When used for
	players this has constant time O(n) for number of connected players (n),
	unlike standard player loops which are O(MAX_PLAYERS), regardless of the
	actual number of connected players.  Even when n is MAX_PLAYERS this is
	still faster.

	13/01/12:
		Fixed the count thanks to AndreT.
